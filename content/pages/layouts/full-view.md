# Full-View Page Layout

This page demonstrates the `full-view` page layout.

There is a header, with navigation and branding.

There is also a footer, with secondary navigation and the standard notices such
as the site content copyright.

Similarly to the [full-screen](/pages/layouts/full-screen) layout, the content
itself is not wrapped in any container, allowing full control over the main
content area.
