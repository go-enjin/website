# Full-Screen Page Layout

This page demonstrates the `full-screen` page layout.

There is no header, no footer and no navigation at all really.

The content itself is still wrapped in a container and this container is
configured to grant the full width and height of the page (without padding or
margins) to the actual content.

Lacking normal navigation, this content is responsible for linking back to the
actual site, if that's even necessary.
