# Full-Page Page Layout

This page demonstrates the `full-page` page layout.

There is a header, with navigation and branding.

There is also a footer, with secondary navigation and the standard notices such
as the site content copyright.

The content itself is still wrapped in a container like the `_default` layout,
however the container is configured to give the full width of the page to the
actual page content.
