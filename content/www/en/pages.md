# Pages

Content within Go-Enjin can be anything the developer chooses, however, it's
nice to not have to reinvent any wheels in the process. This page for example
is written in the Markdown[^1] format.

Enjin pages have many features and more documentation needs to be written, not
just for this but for all of Go-Enjin.

Some of these enjin features are demonstrated with the following pages:

- [Formats](/pages/formats)
    - [HTML](/pages/formats/html)
    - [Markdown](/pages/formats/markdown)
    - [Org-Mode](/pages/formats/org-mode)
    - [Enjin](/pages/formats/enjin)
- [Layouts](/pages/layouts)
    - [default](/pages/layouts/default)
    - [full-page](/pages/layouts/full-page)
    - [full-view](/pages/layouts/full-view)
    - [full-screen](/pages/layouts/full-screen)
- [Archetypes](/pages/archetypes)
  - [blog](/pages/archetypes/blog)
