# Pages

Content within Go-Enjin can be anything the developer chooses, however, it's
nice to not have to reinvent any wheels in the process.

Pages have many features and more documentation needs to be written, not just
for this but for all of Go-Enjin.

Some of these features are demonstrated with the following:

- [Formats](/pages/formats)
    - [HTML](/pages/formats/html)
    - [Markdown](/pages/formats/markdown)
    - [Org-Mode](/pages/formats/org-mode)
    - [Enjin](/pages/formats/enjin)
- [Layouts](/pages/layouts)
    - [default](/pages/layouts/default)
    - [full-page](/pages/layouts/full-page)
    - [full-screen](/pages/layouts/full-screen)
